### About the Sun

1. **Big Yellow Ball**: The sun is that big, bright yellow ball in the sky. It gives us light during the day.

2. **Why We Need the Sun**: The sun helps plants grow, gives us warmth, and keeps us from being too cold. 

3. **Sun’s Happy Face**: If we picture the sun with a face, sometimes it might have a fake smile, like it’s trying hard to shine on a cloudy day. Other times, it has a big, real smile when it’s bright and clear.

4. **Makes Us Feel Good**: The sun’s light helps us feel happier and healthier. It gives us vitamin D, which is good for our bodies.
